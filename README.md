EasyVoiceMessage
==========

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that allows you to record voice messages without having to keep your laser on the tiny square button. (although your laser needs to stay on your dash).

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
2. Place [EasyVoiceMessage.dll](https://github.com/Ryn-Fox/EasyVoiceMessageResonite/releases/download/v1.0.0.0r/EasyVoiceMessage.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
